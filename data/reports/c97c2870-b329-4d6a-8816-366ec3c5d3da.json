      "Explanation": "The ad text and video transcript both emphasize specific features of the Corkcicle products, such as the airtight seal canister and Palm Press, designed to preserve coffee freshness and offer convenience. Its compact size and easy operation make it ideal for travelers, which is highlighted as a primary benefit. Although the problem of lacking good coffee when traveling (due to mistrust of hotel coffee makers) is mentioned, the ad primarily highlights unique product features and benefits (e.g., keeping coffee fresh, being compact, and providing consistent quality). According to the Airtable classification, this makes it a 'Feature-Based Angle' because the focus is on the attributes that make these products stand out for traveling coffee lovers.",
